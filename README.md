## Recommendations
Based on the analysis of Tesla's stock performance from 2010 to early 2025, the following recommendations are suggested:

- **Watch for Big News:** A spike in trading activity was observed in 2020 when Tesla joined the S&P 500. Events like this, as well as earnings reports or product announcements, can strongly impact stock performance and should be closely monitored.
- **Consider Long-Term Investment:** Over the years, Tesla’s stock price has increased significantly (from $1.05 to nearly $480). This suggests Tesla may be better for long-term investors who can handle short-term ups and downs.
- **Don’t Rely on Volume or Price Alone:** The bubble chart below shows no evident patter between the daily return, the volume and the close price. This means volume or price alone doesn’t predict gains or losses. Therefore, more factors should be considered before making a decision.
